	<p>The rose garden witch with a distrustful nature. She holds roses dearer than anything else. 
	She expends all of her power for the sake of beautiful roses. Despite stealing the life-force 
	of humans who wander into her barrier to give to her roses, she loathes the thought of them 
	trampling the inside of her barrier.</p>
