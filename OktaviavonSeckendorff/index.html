	<p>The mermaid witch; it is in her nature to fall in love. Looking for the feeling that moved her so long ago, 
	she moves with the entire concert hall. Her fortune only turns under the weight of memories and no longer moves 
	toward the future. Nothing will reach her any longer. She will come to know nothing more. She simply allows 
	no one to disturb her minions' playing.</p>
